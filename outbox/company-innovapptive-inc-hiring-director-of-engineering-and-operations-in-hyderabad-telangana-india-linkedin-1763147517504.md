The Role

Reporting to: SVP – Operations

Function: Engineering & Product Operations

Partners With: VP Engineering, VP Product, QA Leadership, Architecture, Release Management, CS Ops, and PS Ops




The Director of Engineering Operations (EngOps) is a mission-critical leadership position responsible for driving predictable delivery, high product quality, rigorous governance, and AI-powered engineering insights across the product lifecycle.

As Innovapptive scales from $15M → $50M ARR towards Vision 2028, this role will build and operationalize a world-class Engineering Operating System — transforming our engineering organization into a predictable, data-driven, and AI-first product delivery engine.




This is not a coordination role; it is a leadership role — a mini-COO for Engineering — focused on turning engineering data into actionable insights, driving cross-functional accountability, and elevating engineering execution maturity.




How You Will Make an Impact:




1. Release Governance & Delivery Predictability

Own the end-to-end release governance model (monthly, quarterly, LTS, and patch releases).
Establish disciplined engineering calendars, code freeze policies, and deployment playbooks.
Improve sprint predictability, track planned vs. delivered velocity, and enforce scope control.
Lead release readiness reviews with Product, QA, and Engineering Managers.
Set and monitor automated quality gates for every release.

2. Quality, Stability & RCA Discipline

Build a rigorous system for defect management and regression detection.
Lead Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for every major issue — ensuring systemic fixes.
Strengthen test coverage, regression gates, and environment stability.
Implement SLOs for uptime, performance, and release stability.

3. Engineering Analytics & AI-Powered Insights

Build and own Engineering Intelligence Dashboards across Jira, TestRail, Sentry, and Smartsheet.
Deliver a Weekly Engineering Intelligence Report: insight → action → accountability.
Automate RCA, regression detection, and reporting via AI/LLM workflows.
Predict delays, detect bottlenecks, and forecast risks with actionable insights.

4. Cross-BU Alignment & Friction Removal

Create alignment across Engineering, Product, QA, PSO, and Customer Success.
Define ownership handshakes, SLAs, and workflows to eliminate ambiguity.
Prioritize engineering issues based on customer impact and escalations.
Drive engineering commitments aligned with customer-facing teams.

5. Environment, DevOps & Deployment Stability

Ensure development, QA, UAT, and production environments remain stable and monitored.
Partner with DevOps to strengthen CI/CD reliability and deployment success.
Implement AI-driven anomaly detection for crashes, logs, and infrastructure signals.

6. AI-First Engineering Transformation

Lead 6–8 high-impact AI operationalization projects across Engineering, QA, and Product.
Replace manual updates and coordination with autonomous, AI-driven governance.
Drive automation in reporting, RCA, and operational decisioning.

7. Leadership, Coaching & Organizational Uplift

Elevate engineering culture towards clarity, discipline, and predictability.
Coach Engineering and QA leaders on planning, ownership, and accountability.
Establish KPIs, operating rhythms, and execution habits aligned with Vision 2028.




What You Bring to the Team:

Experience

12–15 years in Engineering, QA, DevOps, or Program Management; 7+ years in EngOps leadership.
Proven success in B2B SaaS (Enterprise SaaS strongly preferred).
Demonstrated ability to stabilize engineering delivery and improve release quality.
Familiarity with CI/CD, automation, observability, and reliability systems.
Experience operating with C-suite visibility and influence.




Skills

Expert in SDLC, Agile/Scrum, Jira workflows, TestRail, and observability tools (Sentry, Datadog, etc.).
Strong analytical mindset with ability to connect cross-system data into insights.
Excellent executive communication and dashboarding skills.
Ability to design AI-driven operational and governance systems.




Leadership Traits

High accountability and ownership mindset.
Systems thinker and decisive leader.
Calm under pressure, collaborative, and low-ego.
Obsessed with quality, predictability, and continuous improvement.
Operates with urgency — without chaos.
Customer-obsessed and impact-driven.




Why This Role Matters

This role directly impacts:

✔ Release predictability

✔ Product stability

✔ Defect leakage reduction

✔ Customer escalations

✔ Engineering → Product → Customer alignment

✔ Cross-BU accountability

✔ On-time delivery commitments

✔ Adoption & renewal outcomes (NRR/GRR)

✔ Vision 2028 execution cadence

This is one of the highest-leverage leadership roles at Innovapptive in 2025.




What We Offer

Opportunity to build the Engineering Operating System for a global SaaS scale-up.
Pivotal role shaping product stability and customer experience across industries.
Direct partnership with CEO, SVP Ops, SVP Engineering, Product, and Customer Success leaders.
Lead Innovapptive’s AI-first transformation in engineering operations.
